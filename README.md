# Code-Review-Analytics

## 📌 About

Code-Review-Analytics is a tool designed to analyze code reviews. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as review depth, review delays, reviewer participation, and compares human code reviews with feedback generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) . This helps improve review consistency, code quality, and team collaboration.

## 🔧 How It Works

- The `run-analytics.yml` workflow is triggered manually (workflow_dispatch) or after code is pushed (if configured).

- It sets up Python, installs dependencies from requirements.txt, and then runs the custom action.

- The action defined in `.github/actions/action/action.yml` runs `main.py` to:

  - Fetch repository metadata (creation & last update date)

  - Fetch Pull Request details (contributors, PRs per day, PR status)

  - Fetch Issue details (open vs closed counts, issue assignees, resolution activity)

  - Generate visualizations for insights.

## 📝 Usage

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

You must set the following as GitHub Secrets for authentication:

`GH_TOKEN` → Your GitHub Personal Access Token

`GH_USERNAME` → Your GitHub username

### Step 2: Trigger the Workflow

Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repo, and manually trigger the `Run Code Review Analytics` workflow.

You can also run it locally:
```
export GH_TOKEN="your_token"
export GH_USERNAME="your_username"
python main.py
```

### Step 3: View Results

- Once the workflow completes, check:
  - The workflow logs for tabular statistics
  - The generated plots directly in your terminal or saved files
  - GitHub Actions artifacts for downloaded results

## 🐍 Python Dependencies

Add your Python libraries in `requirements.txt`:

```txt
requests
matplotlib
pandas
seaborn
```
