# Code-Review-Analytics

## 📌 About

Code-Review-Analytics is a tool designed to analyze code reviews. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as review depth, review delays, reviewer participation, and compares human code reviews with feedback generated by a Large Language Model (LLM). This helps improve review consistency, code quality, and team collaboration.

## 🚀 Features

- Automated code review analysis
- KPI tracking for review depth and delays
- Reviewer participation metrics
- LLM integration for review comparison
- Visualization of review patterns
- Detailed analytics reports

## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/eshabalaji/Code-Review-Analytics.git
   cd Code-Review-Analytics
   ```

2. Install required dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

## 🔑 Configuration

Before using the tool, ensure you have:
1. A GitHub Personal Access Token with appropriate permissions
2. Access to the repository you want to analyze
3. Python 3.7 or higher installed

## 🔧 How It Works

- The `run-analytics.yml` workflow is triggered manually (workflow_dispatch) or after code is pushed (if configured).

- It sets up Python, installs dependencies from requirements.txt, and then runs the custom action.
- The action defined in `.github/actions/action/action.yml` runs `main.py` to:
  * **Data Collection** (`github_api.py`):
    * Fetch repository metadata (creation & last update date, stars, forks)
    * Fetch commit history and group by date/author
    * Fetch contributor statistics and participation levels
    * Fetch detailed Pull Request data (reviews, comments, merge times, interactions)
    * Fetch Issue details (open vs closed counts, resolution activity, closers)
  * **Analysis & Visualization** (`visualizations.py`):
    * Generate commit activity charts (daily trends, author contributions)
    * Create PR analytics (timeline, merge time distribution, review patterns)
    * Build collaboration heatmaps (who reviews whom)
    * Plot issue resolution metrics and contributor activity
  * **Data Export**:
    * Save 7 detailed CSV files for further analysis
    * Export comprehensive review and comment datasets
    * Generate combined reports for easy data consumption

## 📝 Usage

### Step 1: Set Up Environment Variables

You must set the following as GitHub Secrets for authentication:

`GITHUB_TOKEN` → Your GitHub Personal Access Token

`OWNER` → Repository owner

`REPO` → Repository name

### Step 2: Trigger the Workflow

Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repo, and manually trigger the `Run Code Review Analytics` workflow.

You can also run it locally:
```
export GITHUB_TOKEN="your_token"
export OWNER="repository_owner"
export REPO="repository_name"
python main.py
```

### Step 3: View Results

- Once the workflow completes, check:
  - The workflow logs for tabular statistics
  - The generated plots directly in your terminal or saved files
  - GitHub Actions artifacts for downloaded results
