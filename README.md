# Code-Review-Analytics
Human code reviews play a critical role in ensuring code quality, readability, and team collaboration. However, they are often inconsistent. This project aims to analyze and improve code reviews by collecting KPIs (Key Performance Indicators), building review analytics tools, and using Generative AI (LLMs) to compare and enhance human reviews.
