# Code-Review-Analytics

## 📌 About

Code-Review-Analytics is a tool designed to analyze code reviews. It tracks key performance indicators (KPIs) such as review depth, review delays, reviewer participation, and compares human code reviews with feedback generated by a Large Language Model (LLM) . This helps improve review consistency, code quality, and team collaboration.

## 🔧 How It Works

- The `run-analytics.yml` workflow is triggered manually (`workflow_dispatch`).
- It sets up Python, installs dependencies from `requirements.txt`, and then runs the custom action.
- The action defined in `.github/actions/action/action.yml` runs `extract.py` to generate analytics.

## 📝 Usage

### Step 1: Trigger the Workflow

Navigate to the **Actions** tab in your GitHub repo, and manually trigger the `Run Code Review Analytics` workflow.

### Step 2: View Results

Once the workflow completes, check the workflow logs or download generated files (if any) from the "Artifacts" section.
